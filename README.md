Enter a number of bits or states in a space and the calculator will estimate how many uniformly random attempts you will have to make at selecting one item in the space before you can expect to have seen all the states at least once with a few given confidence levels.

For example, the calculator can tell you that if you have an 8 bit number and you pick 2104 random values you will have a 95% chance of having seen all 256 possible values.

The available confidence values are 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%, 99%, 99.9%, 99.99%.
